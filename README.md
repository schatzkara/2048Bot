# 2048Bot
Senior Seminar Project

This is an adversarial search bot for the 2048 game. To run, make edits in main.py to specify the following parameters:
    which heuristic you want to use
    the number of moves you want to look ahead
    the number of trials for the Monte Carlo simulation
    play 2048 with the bot or just regular game
    record a log of the game or not
Then, you can run main.py, and the GUI will appear. Press the start button to begin the game.
